        I found coding in high school through changing my code on the social media blog site, Tumblr. 
        I always wanted to go to school for coding, but just recently made the leap to start learning! 
        I am so excited to be doing something that excites me and I look forward to a new career.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I have been in the workforce since the age of 14 and graduated high school at 16.
        I have 12 years of experience in a team setting.
        I'm known for being a top performer and a leader in my roles. I am a fast learning problem solver looking for a team willing
        to work with me on my career development as a web developer.

          I did a demonstration speech in high school on HTML basics using Tumblr as a pseudo code editor!
